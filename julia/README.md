# julia/ — three modules: basic algebra / transcendental / scalar

All three are standalone (stdlib only) and carry the ⚠️ AI-assisted banner. Run each with
`julia <file>` for its self-test.

| file | module | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| **`HyperAlgebra.jl`** | `HyperAlgebra` | Array/batch total arithmetic **+ swappable wiring tensor** (`group_mul`) — the Julia mirror of `cuda_total.py`, written generically so it is `CuArray`-ready (GPU). Use this for the same thing the Python library does. |
| **`ScalarTot.jl`** | `ScalarTot` | Total arithmetic **as a Julia `Number`**: `TotNum <: Real` overloads `+ - * / ^ exp log ...`, so **existing generic code runs on it unchanged** — an ODE solver from OrdinaryDiffEq.jl solves with `TotNum` and the flag names *where/which-direction* the computation left the machine's representable range. This is the "used, not demo" bridge. |
| **`NestedSeries.jl`** | `NestedSeries` | The M/N/O layers as **freely composable registries** over one `Alg` interface: cells (`cd_alg`/`cyclic_alg`/`matn_alg`) × combinators (`mat_over`, `tensor` — recursive: `mat_over(tensor(cd_alg(4),cd_alg(2)),2)` just works) × coefficient tapes (`:exp :sin :cos :sinh :cosh` + user-defined). Nothing assumed per combination: `assoc_defect`/`powerassoc_defect` measure the composed algebra, `nlog` verifies with forward exp or flags INEXACT. Measured law: **exp∘log verifies iff POWER-associativity holds** — octonion/sedenion scalars (non-associative, power-associative) verify at 1e-16; `mat2⟨cd16⟩` loses power-associativity (0.97) and breaks structurally (7e-3). |
| **`HyperTranscend.jl`** | `HyperTranscend` | **Experimental** unified computation of `exp`/`log`/`sqrt`/`^` for any M = 2^k via `f(x) = f(L_x)·e₀` (function values through the left regular representation — *not* a proof that every hypercomplex analytic function is captured; identities are **checked per dimension** in `self_test()`). Forward ops (`*`, `exp`, `x^{p≥0}`, `√`) stay total for every input incl. zero divisors — `√0 = 0` even though `L_0` is singular.  Only genuine **inversion** (`log`, `x^{neg}`) needs `L_x` nonsingular; a zero divisor there is named `⟦零因子⟧`. **Safe forward group** (`exp sin cos sinh cosh`, `x^{p≥0}` via `left_power` with explicit bracketing, `left_action(a,x0,t)=exp(t·L_a)·x0` for sedenion-valued linear ODEs) is total for every input. **Candidate group** (`sqrt log x^{frac}`) computes then **verifies the defining identity by a non-recursive residual** — trusted only if it holds, else flagged `⟦INEXACT⟧` (never a silent lie); `verify_sqrt`/`verify_log` are exposed for the caller. |

## `demo_ode_blowup.jl` — a third-party solver, unchanged, naming the blow-up

Run `julia demo_ode_blowup.jl` (needs `OrdinaryDiffEq`, which you install yourself —
**it is not vendored here**; the demo only *calls* it). Solving `du/dt = u²` on `[0,2]`
(true solution `1/(1−t)`, ∞ at `t=1`):

```
Float64 : retcode = Unstable      ← aborts "dt below eps / unstable"; where? which? unknown
TotNum  : retcode = Success       ← same model, same solver, only u0::TotNum
          ★ first flag at t = 0.99998  →  ...e292 ⟦≥≤±⟧
          (named just before the true blow-up t = 1.0, no NaN; finishes holding ±MAX)
```

This is the forum pain answered: a NaN/instability that Float64 reports as an opaque abort
becomes, by *switching the number type* (not editing the solver or the model), a named
event — the step and direction at which the run left representable range — flowing straight
through the external library's internals. This is what `ScalarTot`'s `Number` interface buys
that Python cannot.

**The through-line.** `TotNum` (scalar) is the M = 1 case of `Hyper` (any M): a hypercomplex
number is its left-multiplication matrix `L_x`, and every operation — product, power, exp,
log, sqrt — is one recipe with M and the wiring table as the only knobs. Forward computation
is uniformly total across all M; the single place anything breaks is *inversion*, and it
breaks the same way everywhere (`L_x` singular). The flag is not "the algebra broke" — it is
"you asked for an inverse that has no unique answer." (Scalars/complex/quaternion/octonion
are division algebras and never hit it; zero divisors first appear at M = 16, the sedenions.)
